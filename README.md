# FoodVision_V1
Practice to figure out how to use pretrained models, HuggingFace transformers and create custom datasets by getting images from the web (used HuggingFace search api).

Access model on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/DiazOnFire/FoodVision).

### training_model
Notebook containing custom dataset creation and fine-tuning model using PyTorch Lightning
Google Vision Transformer has been used.

### InferenceForFoodVision
Notebook where the fine-tuned model was imported from HuggingFace. Prediction made by model on an image(via URL) as well.
